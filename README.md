# Agents - Level of separation

Hi 

I used Vue.js and Vue Cli to create the project

### What to do?
```
git clone https://github.com/guylil/isolationLevels.git
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```
### What else to see?

I didn't have a lot of time for that (sorry), so I didn't do the bonus part

The thing is, it is working but I couldn't help having the feeling that there is a much better way 
to do the stuff I was trying to do... Due to the lack of time I couldn't find anyway better (but there has to be right?) 


Please give me a call while you are reviewing that as everything I did here was for a reason

Cheers
